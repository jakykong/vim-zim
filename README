Zim Desktop Wiki plugin for Vim
================================

This Zim plugin provides the following additions to Vim for use with Zim wiki files:
* Syntax highlighting and filetype detection for Zim files
* Commands to bold, italicize, strike, or mark text.
* A command to add a header to new Zim files.

A typical workflow for use with this is one of:
* Create files in Zim, and use Tools->Edit Source to access Vim.
* Create files in Vim, and (re)start Zim to read them.

Known issues:
* Zim header command uses strftime, but due to working around Microsoft issues,
  it presently only supports Pacific Time Zone, and does not support Linux.
  Adding time zones is easy (look at the plugin file), so is adding Linux support
  (place and method marked in the same file), I just haven't needed to.
* Not an issue with the plugin, but with Zim: There is no way to refresh the index
  in Zim without restarting Zim. This implies that new files added from Vim will
  not be visible there until it's restarted.
* No helpfile written yet.

Commands:
<Leader>wt - Header (accepts count 1-5): ====HEADER==== syntax in file (Normal mode)
<Leader>wh - Highlight __Highlighted Text__ syntax (Visual mode)
<Leader>wb - Bold text (in normal mode, bolds entire line, not including bullets or checkboxes if present)
<Leader>wi - Italic text (in normal mode, bolds entire line, not including bullets or checkboxes if present)
<Leader>ws - Strike text (in normal mode, bolds entire line, not including bullets or checkboxes if present)
<Leader>wl - Make current line a list item
<Leader>wc - Put empty checkbox on the current line 
<F12>      - 'yes' Put validated checkbox on the current line
<S-F12>    - 'no'  Put crossed checkbox on the current line
<Leader><CR>- Detect if inside a list and continue to insert bullets
<CR>        - Same as above if the cursor is at the end of the line
<Leader>wH or
:CreateZimHeader()
           - Creates a Zim header in the current document. Required for Zim to correctly render new files.
